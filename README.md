# SystemAnnihilator

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️

This program is a **system killer** that completely destroys a Windows machine at the core level, from wiping the boot sector, encrypting files, deleting registry keys, to forcing a hard reboot.  
It is designed strictly for **local experimental use only** under your full responsibility.  
**Using it on any device other than your own is dangerous, illegal, and I hold no liability for any damage caused.**
